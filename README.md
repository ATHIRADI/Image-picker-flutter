  This project is a Flutter-based mobile app that allows users to pick images from their deviceâ€™s gallery or capture photos using the camera. The selected or captured images are displayed within the app, and users can also delete images with a confirmation prompt. The app incorporates key features such as:

Image Selection: Users can choose images from their device's gallery or capture photos using the camera.
Snackbar Notifications: Visual notifications appear when an image is selected, captured, or deleted.
Image Display: The selected image is shown in a responsive container with a rounded border.
Delete Functionality: Users can delete the displayed image, with a confirmation dialog ensuring accidental deletions are avoided.
Bottom Sheet: A modal bottom sheet provides options for selecting images from the gallery or camera.
Error Handling: Error messages notify users when something goes wrong during image picking or capturing.
This project demonstrates the use of Flutter's ImagePicker package for handling media files and incorporates state management to update the UI dynamically when images are selected, captured, or deleted. The app includes basic UI enhancements like floating action buttons, snackbars, and modal bottom sheets to improve user interaction.
